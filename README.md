# LinkScrapperForTelegramGroup

During my Masters we had a telegram group for sharing recorded lecture videos. Over the course of 2 years almost 400 lectures were recorded. However links were not in order and it was hard to scroll and look for correct lecture. I created this tiny script to get lecture links and group them by lecture and order each lecture link by date. I am saving this here for future referance:)
